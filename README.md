# Wolt_User_Segmentation_Assignment
In this repository you’ll find a dataset in the zipped file with some machine-generated user data of a service like Wolt. Every row of the dataset represents one customer who has registered to use the service during September 2019 and either has or hasn’t made orders during the time from then and October 2020.

**The assignment consists of two main purposes:**
1. Familiarise myself with the dataset. Here I will perform exploratory analysis skills.
2. Create a user segmentation that could be utilised by marketing team to reactivate different kinds of users. Provide also recommendations on how to use the segmentation for this purpose. 

**NOTE**: there are many interactive charts and graphs in the notebook that will require to re-run the code to make them work. If you do not want to re-run the codes, please use the html version.
